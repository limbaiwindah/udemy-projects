          You know... well, I didn't really say about loving or not loving making hats in the movie, but... 
          I actually just sit there just because I'm the eldest. Naturally, I will have to continue the shop, right?

          It was eventful outside; the soilders were coming back. The ladies are in their fancy clothes with fancy hats.
          Why not I go out for a while? I'm gonna meet my sister. Absurd that I'm wearing the plainest hat being that I sew hats.

          This is a fast story, but it's better if you watch my actual movie. The person writing this right now is so excited to
          write her CSS yk... Anyways, a blond hottie somehow crossed path (?) with me and... I'm running away... from liquid people-- yeah.

          Well... a lot happened. A rude lady came into my hat shop and started insulting the hats and me. So I showed her the door, 
          and I got wrinkly skin. Lol. Now these dress finally fits me though. I'm at the hottie Howl's Moving Castle btw.

          I forgot what happened before this, but as you can see I look young here- ehem I <span class="emphasize">am</span> young ok?
          Anyways, I think Howl have started to like me here lol, cuz why else is he showing a field of garden to me? That wasn't an actual
          question btw.
