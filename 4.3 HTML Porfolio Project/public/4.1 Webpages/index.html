                <p>Sophie Hatter was never the confident, standout type. As the quiet eldest daughter of a hat maker, she struggled with
                self-doubt, feeling like she was always in the shadow of others. When a curse turns her into an elderly woman, Sophie is
                thrust into a world full of uncertainty, where she must confront her insecurities and step into the unknown. Over time,
                through unexpected adventures and the people she meets—especially Howl—Sophie discovers that true strength comes not
                from perfection, but from accepting and embracing her imperfections. Through it all, she learns to believe in herself
                and becomes the quiet hero of her own story.
