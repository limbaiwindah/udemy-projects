                <h3>1. Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
                <p>This movie is one of my comfort movie; I can't count how many times I have watched it. The best part is that it never
                    gets boring. Maybe it did, but it's always a good watch.</p>

                <h3>2. My Neighbour Totoro</h3>
                <p>I love the whimsicality in this movie. One of the character, Mei Kusakabe is particularly interesting and fun to me
                    (maybe because I am also the last child). She is very childish and kinda spoiled, kinda like me too. But I
                    understand this story very much. Maybe it is my actual number one on this list.</p>

                <h3>3. We Made a Beautiful Bouquet</h3>
                <p>This movie is a Japanese movie, which I rarely watch. It was heartbreaking and at the same time, so real - it depicts
                    how a relationship can die to the point where there is no feelings anymore. I cried a lot watching this movie. It
                    was very emotional. I guess it's the wish that I have for my own relationship to not end up like that, or maybe it
                    was the past that I see myself in it.</p>
